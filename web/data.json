It supports basic features: sending/receiving emails, contact synchronization, and integration with other email services. It also includes file storage (Inbox Files). Suitable for everyday communication and data storage. Security & Anonymity: Utilizes SSL encryption for data transmission and two-factor authentication (2FA) for login, providing a basic level of security. However, it lacks end-to-end encryption, leaving email content vulnerable to interception or access by the service. Anonymity is low: personal data (name, surname, birth date, gender, IP, location, contacts) is collected and shared with ad partners (Google, AD BOX) for personalized ads and with authorities upon request. Data is stored in Latvia, subject to local laws and GDPR, but third-party access isn’t ruled out. Ideal for simple communication, temporary registrations, or storing non-sensitive data, especially in the free version. The paid PREMIUM version removes ads and adds features but doesn’t enhance privacy. Not recommended for confidential correspondence—it falls behind Proton Mail or Tutanota due to weak anonymity and lack of full content protection.

Hosting is provided in its own ISO 27001-certified data center in Switzerland. The service focuses on security and privacy, with a basic free tier (200 MB, no IMAP/SMTP) and paid plans with enhanced features. Security & Anonymity: Wölkli Mail employs 256-bit SSL encryption for data transmission and AES-256 server-side encryption for stored emails. It supports OpenPGP for message encryption and decryption, along with two-factor authentication (2FA). Emails are encrypted with user-specific cryptographic keys before reaching the inbox, preventing even the service provider from accessing their contents. Data is stored in Switzerland, benefiting from strict privacy laws (DSG). However, full anonymity isn’t guaranteed: registration requires a name, surname, and a strong password (min. 12 characters), and IP addresses may be logged. The privacy policy lacks detailed disclosure about data collection, leaving some uncertainty regarding anonymity. The free version (200 MB, 20 MB attachment limit, ad-free) is suitable for basic correspondence, temporary registrations, or non-sensitive data via the web interface (based on RainLoop, with Russian language support). Paid tiers, offering more storage and IMAP/SMTP access, are ideal for personal or professional use requiring encryption and reliability. Thanks to Swiss jurisdiction and cryptographic features, it’s a good fit for users prioritizing above-average privacy, though for maximum anonymity (e.g., no personal data required), alternatives like Proton Mail or Tutanota might be preferable.",

It offers free email accounts with the @interia.pl domain, alongside access to news, social features, and other services. It supports standard IMAP, SMTP, and POP3 protocols, enabling use with third-party clients (e.g., Outlook, Thunderbird). The service targets a broad audience, providing basic communication tools integrated with the portal. Security & Anonymity: Interia.pl employs SSL/TLS encryption for data transmission (port 993 for IMAP, 465 for SMTP), offering a baseline level of security. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is supported, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. However, it lacks end-to-end encryption, meaning email content is stored unencrypted on servers and accessible to administrators. Anonymity is limited: registration requires personal details (e.g., name), and the service collects internet data (IP, activity, device info), which may be shared with advertising partners (Google, Facebook) and authorities upon request. Data is stored in Poland (EU), adhering to GDPR, but may be transferred outside the EEA (e.g., to the USA) with standard contractual safeguards. A data breach in 2023 (14.2 KB, including emails) raises concerns about its security track record. Use Cases: The free Interia.pl email is suitable for everyday communication, website registrations, receiving newsletters, or casual use. Its IMAP/SMTP support makes it convenient for users who prefer desktop or mobile clients. However, due to weak anonymity and lack of end-to-end encryption, it’s not recommended for confidential correspondence or scenarios requiring high privacy (unlike Proton Mail or Tutanota). It’s a versatile, basic tool with moderate protection, best for non-critical needs rather than a specialized security solution.",

Using the email requires registration with personal details (e.g., email, name, age, gender, city), and it collects activity data (views, clicks, purchase history), device info, location, and cookies. Encryption is present (SSL/TLS is implied for web access), but end-to-end email encryption is absent, meaning message content is accessible to the provider. IP addresses and metadata are not hidden, and data may be shared with partners (e.g., Google, Facebook) for advertising with user consent. Privacy is limited: data is stored in Poland/EEA but may be transferred outside the EEA with safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses). Users must secure their passwords, but the service doesn’t offer maximum anonymity, as it prioritizes personalization and marketing. The privacy policy was last updated on July 26, 2023.  Use Cases: Onet is suitable for everyday communication, news reading, and using additional features (forums, shopping) within a single platform, especially for Poland-based users or those comfortable in a Polish-language ecosystem.

            "value": "Datamail is an email service provided by the Indian company Data Xgen Technologies Pvt Ltd, launched as part of a digital initiative. It offers free email accounts with the @datamail.in domain, accessible via a web interface and mobile application. The service supports contact synchronization, basic communication features, and integration with advertising services. To register, you must install the official Datamail app on your phone (available for Android and iOS), tying the process to a mobile device. Security & Anonymity: Datamail employs SSL encryption to secure data transmission and provides two-factor authentication (2FA) to enhance login security. However, it lacks end-to-end encryption, meaning email content remains accessible to the company as data is stored unencrypted on servers. Anonymity is minimal: registration via the app requires personal details (name, email, phone number, sometimes credit card), alongside device information (model, OS, IP, identifiers) and usage data (logs, queries, contacts). This data may be shared with partners (e.g., advertisers) or authorities upon request, with servers located across multiple countries, reducing privacy control. The privacy policy (last updated December 22, 2016) emphasizes personalization over anonymity. Datamail is suitable for basic communication, sending emails, syncing contacts, or registering on websites where high privacy isn’t a priority. The mobile app makes it convenient for phone-based users, particularly in India, where it’s promoted as a local alternative. However, due to weak anonymity, lack of end-to-end encryption, and extensive data collection, it’s not recommended for confidential correspondence or scenarios requiring identity protection (unlike Proton Mail or Tutanota). It’s a general-purpose tool for everyday tasks with moderate security, aimed at mainstream users.",

The service focuses on simplicity: registration involves filling out a form with basic details, followed by access using a login and password. It supports core email functions like sending and receiving messages but does not mention IMAP/SMTP support or mobile apps. Security & Anonymity: TopMail.kz claims to protect data with organizational and technical measures, but specific methods (e.g., SSL or end-to-end encryption) are not detailed, leaving its security level unclear. Password security (recommended at least 8 characters with numbers and symbols) is the user’s responsibility, and its loss poses risks. Anonymity is limited: registration requires name, surname, gender, and an additional email, while IP addresses are collected for stats. Data is stored in Kazakhstan and shared only with authorities if legally required, with no mention of advertising partners or third parties, offering better privacy than services like Gmail. However, the lack of encryption and mandatory personal data reduces anonymity. The privacy policy was last updated on July 31, 2017. TopMail.kz is suitable for basic correspondence, local communication in Kazakhstan, or registering on sites where high confidentiality isn’t needed. It’s a straightforward option for users who value minimalism and the absence of ad-related data sharing, as well as those comfortable with Kazakhstan’s jurisdiction. However, due to unclear security and required personal details, it’s not ideal for anonymous use or highly private correspondence (unlike Proton Mail or Tutanota).

Dmail positions itself as a secure and versatile platform for communication in the decentralized internet, blending traditional email capabilities with Web3 innovations.  Security & Anonymity: Dmail Network prioritizes privacy and security. The service employs decentralized data storage, splitting email headers and bodies: headers are recorded on the blockchain, while bodies are encrypted with a token and distributed across the network, eliminating centralized vulnerabilities. It uses end-to-end encryption, ensuring only the sender and recipient can decrypt messages. For enhanced anonymity, Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) are implemented, allowing identity verification without revealing personal data. Registration requires creating a Web3 address but not necessarily providing personal details, boosting anonymity. However, full anonymity isn’t guaranteed, as activity data and IP addresses may be collected for analytics and service improvement, and could be shared with third parties under legal mandates (per Singapore law).  Use Cases: Dmail is ideal for users within the Web3 ecosystem, including crypto enthusiasts, dApp developers, marketers, and influencers who value secure communication and blockchain integration. Its compatibility with Web2 emails (ability to send to regular addresses) makes it a convenient bridge from traditional to decentralized services. It’s suitable for:      Confidential correspondence with encryption.     Managing NFT domains and tokens directly within the email platform.     Cross-chain notifications and communication between blockchains.     Web3 marketing campaigns (MailtoEarn allows earning points). However, due to its Web3 focus and some data collection (IP, device info), it’s less suited for absolute anonymity compared to services like Proton Mail.

            "value": "Mailchain is a decentralized email service designed for Web3, enabling users to send and receive encrypted messages between blockchain addresses (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon, etc.). Built on decentralization principles, Mailchain integrates with Web3 wallets, leverages cryptographic keys for identification and encryption, and gives users control over their data. It’s more than just email—it’s a communication platform for the Web3 ecosystem, supporting messaging via blockchain addresses and user-friendly names (e.g., username@mailchain.com).  Security & Anonymity: Mailchain offers a high level of privacy through end-to-end encryption, ensuring that message content is accessible only to the sender and recipient—Mailchain itself cannot decrypt it. Messages are stored encrypted in the user’s mailbox, with keys (identity key, messaging key) managed by the user via a secret recovery phrase. For anonymity, data collection is minimal: IP addresses are briefly processed via Fathom Analytics without identifying individuals, and personal details (e.g., name or email) aren’t required for registration—just a Web3 address. However, full anonymity isn’t guaranteed: technical data (authentication tokens, public keys) is collected for functionality, and information may be disclosed under legal mandates (England and Wales jurisdiction). The lack of centralized control enhances security, but users must safeguard their keys—losing them means losing access without recovery options from Mailchain.  Use Cases: Mailchain is ideal for Web3 users, such as crypto wallet owners, decentralized app (dApp) developers, DAO participants, and crypto enthusiasts. It’s a great fit for:      Secure correspondence between blockchain addresses with encryption.     Communication within decentralized communities without intermediaries.     Integration with Web3 identities and names (e.g., ENS).     Confidential messaging within the crypto ecosystem. It’s less suited for traditional communication (e.g., with Gmail) as it targets the Web3 audience and doesn’t provide absolute anonymity due to potential legal data disclosure. It’s a tool for those who value decentralization, data control, and security in the context of blockchain technologies.",

Security & Anonymity: LedgerMail prioritizes privacy by encrypting data during transit and storage using industry-standard protocols (e.g., TLS for transit, though specifics aren’t detailed). All data, including email content, is stored encrypted with strict access controls in place. However, anonymity is limited: registration requires providing a name, email address, physical address, and optionally a company name, making it less anonymous than platforms like Proton Mail or Mailchain. IP addresses and usage data (browser type, ISP, timestamps) are collected for analytics and service improvement but not tied to personal identification. Data isn’t shared with third parties except as legally required (UAE jurisdiction, compliant with CCPA and GDPR). Account deactivation triggers data deletion, emphasizing user control, but the lack of end-to-end encryption reduces privacy for message content.  Use Cases: LedgerMail is suitable for Web3 users looking to integrate email with decentralized technologies while maintaining a baseline level of security. It’s a good fit for:      Business communication with data encryption (e.g., for small companies or freelancers).     Personalized correspondence with optional profile picture customization.     Transitioning from traditional email to Web3-oriented solutions. However, due to mandatory registration data and lack of full anonymity, it’s not ideal for highly confidential correspondence or anonymous use.

Onion Mail targets users who prioritize anonymity and safeguarding against surveillance, offering a decentralized messaging platform within the darknet and beyond.  Security & Anonymity: Onion Mail stands out for its exceptional privacy and anonymity features. Messages are encrypted with PGP, ensuring end-to-end encryption—content is accessible only to the sender and recipient, with the service itself unable to view the text. Operating through the Tor network hides users’ IP addresses by routing traffic through multiple nodes, making it nearly impossible to trace the sender or receiver. Registration doesn’t require personal data (name or email can be omitted), and encryption keys are generated and stored by the user, enhancing security control. However, minimal data (IP, browser type, access times) is automatically collected for statistics and abuse prevention, though it doesn’t identify individuals. Data isn’t shared with third parties except under legal mandates (New York, USA jurisdiction). Full anonymity relies on proper Tor usage and key management by the user.  Use Cases: Onion Mail is ideal for those seeking maximum confidentiality and anonymity in communication, especially under censorship or surveillance conditions. It’s a perfect fit for:      Anonymous messaging via the darknet (e.g., with other .onion users).     Protecting correspondence for activists, journalists, or whistleblowers where secrecy is critical.     Sending emails to standard addresses while preserving sender anonymity.     Individuals avoiding mass surveillance and valuing independence from big corporations. The service is user-friendly but requires the Tor Browser, making it less convenient for everyday tasks compared to traditional email providers. It’s not suited for commercial purposes or bulk messaging, but rather for those willing to trade convenience for security and anonymity in specific scenarios, such as darknet activities or protection from repression. Onion Mail is a niche tool for users who prioritize privacy above all else.",

Designed to ensure freedom of communication in the darknet, DNMX functions like Gmail or Yahoo Mail but prioritizes anonymity and data protection. It’s a service for those who want to communicate without censorship or surveillance, maintaining privacy in the digital realm.  Security & Anonymity: DNMX offers a high degree of anonymity by neither requesting nor storing users’ personal information—your identity isn’t required to use the service. Access is restricted to the Tor network, concealing IP addresses and locations by routing traffic through multiple nodes. Servers are secured with full disk encryption, rendering data inaccessible even if physically seized. However, the service doesn’t guarantee built-in end-to-end encryption for messages and strongly recommends using PGP for sensitive correspondence, cautioning that even they shouldn’t be fully trusted. A minimal data collection policy suggests no identifying information is retained, and there’s no mention of sharing with third parties (likely minimal due to its darknet context). Privacy hinges on user actions, including PGP use and Tor compliance.  Use Cases: DNMX is ideal for darknet users who value free speech and basic anonymity without complex setups. It’s well-suited for:      Anonymous communication within the Tor network, such as with other darknet users.     Individuals evading censorship from authorities or corporations.     Simple correspondence in scenarios requiring minimal identification. The service prohibits terrorism, blackmail, or other crimes, making it unsuitable for illegal activities. Due to the lack of built-in message encryption, it’s less ideal for highly sensitive data (e.g., for journalists or activists) unless PGP is applied. DNMX is a practical tool for those who prioritize anonymity and communication freedom in the darknet, willing to bolster security themselves if needed. It’s best for basic tasks with a focus on privacy within the Tor ecosystem.",

Incorporated in the British Virgin Islands with IT operations subcontracted in Vancouver, Canada, XMail provides users with a simple and minimalist communication tool through an Ajax-powered browser interface. The service also offers 1 GB of mailbox storage and 1 GB for personal web hosting, making it a versatile option for basic internet tasks.  Security & Anonymity: XMail stands out with its privacy policy: it collects no personal or demographic information during signup—users only need to choose a username and password. This ensures a high degree of anonymity, as no identity disclosure is required. The service is accessible via standard browsers, including Tor-compatible ones (e.g., Brave), adding optional anonymity when used through the Tor network. For secure communication, XMail supports S/MIME with personal certificates, enabling end-to-end encryption and digital signatures to verify sender authenticity. However, full data protection relies on utilizing these certificates, as server-side encryption isn’t specified. Inactive accounts are deleted after one year, preventing the accumulation of abandoned data. There’s no mention of data sharing with third parties, leaving legal obligations unclear (BVI jurisdiction).  Use Cases: XMail is suitable for users who value basic anonymity and straightforward privacy without complexity. It’s a good fit for:      Anonymous correspondence via the web interface or Tor (with S/MIME for encryption).     Storing small amounts of data (1 GB for email and web files).

Operating under German legislation (§ 7-10 TMG), the service offers basic functionality for users who want to avoid intrusive data collection, emphasizing voluntary information disclosure and protection against unsolicited advertising.  Security & Anonymity: Monocles Mail ensures a high level of anonymity through its minimal data collection policy: the service can be used without providing personal information, and any data (e.g., name, address, email) is requested only on a voluntary basis. For related features (Monocles search and translator), no IP addresses or user actions are logged, with settings stored locally on the user’s device, preventing tracking by the service.

Built with cutting-edge encryption technologies and a \"zero-knowledge\" approach, Atomic Mail positions itself as a secure alternative to traditional email services, drawing inspiration from blockchain ecosystem security standards.  Security & Anonymity: Atomic Mail offers a high level of anonymity and privacy. Registration doesn’t require a real name—users only need to select an email (e.g., user@atomicmail.io) and password, with the option to use a pseudonym. No personal data is collected, and passwords are hashed (SHA-256) and never stored in plaintext. Messages are encrypted client-side with AES-256 (for all users) and ECIES (between Atomic Mail users), ensuring end-to-end encryption—Atomic Mail itself cannot access email content. A BIP39 seed phrase, kept by the user, enables account recovery, eliminating reliance on the service. Website visitor IP addresses are logged for 7 days to combat spam, but emails display Atomic Mail’s server IP, not the user’s. Data isn’t shared with third parties except under valid Estonian court orders—requests from foreign authorities are ignored. Access via Tor is possible, enhancing anonymity. However, losing both the password and seed phrase makes recovery impossible, a deliberate security feature.  Use Cases: Atomic Mail is suited for users who prioritize strong privacy and data protection without compromise. It’s an excellent choice for:      Confidential correspondence with robust encryption (e.g., between Atomic Mail users via ECIES).     Sending secure emails to external recipients (password-protected via Decryption Service).     Individuals avoiding surveillance and valuing key control (thanks to the seed phrase).     Those seeking a free, ad-free service with minimal data collection. It’s not ideal for bulk messaging (due to spam restrictions) or users needing support without technical know-how (no recovery guarantees if data is lost). Atomic Mail is perfect for self-reliant users, such as journalists, activists, or tech-savvy individuals, who value anonymity and independence within Estonia’s strict jurisdiction.",

Security & Anonymity: Mailio ensures a high level of privacy with end-to-end encryption for messages within its domain and a \"zero-knowledge\" architecture—meaning the company cannot access encrypted email content. No personal data is required for registration, though an optional email can be provided for verification or recovery. IP addresses, emails, or phone numbers used for verification (e.g., via reCaptcha, SMS) are stored temporarily and hashed if retained long-term, making identification difficult. Permanent IP logs aren’t kept unless abuse (spam, attacks) occurs, where data may be stored to protect the service. Metadata (sender, recipient, subject, timestamps) is accessible due to SMTP limitations, but encrypted message content isn’t. Unencrypted incoming emails are scanned for spam and viruses, justified by user protection needs. Data isn’t shared with third parties except under binding Slovenian legal requests (with user notification if permitted). Payments via Stripe or anonymously (Bitcoin/cash) offer flexibility, though card linkage may reduce anonymity. For full anonymity, using Tor/VPN is recommended, as traffic passes through third-party networks.  Use Cases: Mailio is suitable for users seeking a private email service with strong data protection and minimal tracking.

It offers a minimalist solution for email communication, avoiding excessive data collection and providing a basic level of anonymity and protection.  Security & Anonymity: Mailum ensures a high degree of anonymity through its minimal data collection policy. Registration requires only a username and password (hashed), with no need to provide personal details like a real name or email. IP addresses aren’t logged for website visitors, except for a 5-minute retention during registration to prevent account flooding (this data isn’t linked to users and is deleted afterward). The date of the last login is stored for managing inactive accounts, but no other activity traces are kept. The absence of logs and external trackers (e.g., for advertising) enhances privacy. Cookies are used solely for session identification, without additional tracking. However, there’s no mention of message or server encryption, suggesting a lack of default end-to-end encryption. Data isn’t shared with third parties, and GDPR/CCPA rights ensure user control over information. For full anonymity, using Tor or a VPN is recommended.  Use Cases: Mailum is suitable for those seeking a simple, anonymous communication method without heavy oversight. It’s a good fit for:      Basic correspondence with minimal identity disclosure.     Users avoiding tracking and ads (the service is entirely free of external scripts).     Those wanting a quick email setup without sharing personal data. It’s not ideal for highly sensitive tasks (e.g., protection from authorities or sending confidential data), as there’s no mention of encryption or advanced security measures. Mailum is optimal for low-risk everyday use where simplicity and lack of surveillance matter, especially when paired with additional anonymization tools. It’s a solution for minimalists who value basic privacy without complex configurations.",

            "value": "CodaMail is an email service provided by Packetderm, LLC (USA, Massachusetts), also known through Cotse.Net, with a strong focus on safeguarding user privacy. Accessible via https://codamail.com, CodaMail combines minimal data collection with robust encryption, offering a secure communication solution centered on privacy and user control.  Security & Anonymity: CodaMail ensures a high level of privacy through strict principles: it collects only the bare minimum of data (account name, subscription details, creation/expiration dates), and email content is individually encrypted at rest using elliptic-curve AES-GCM-256. It supports zero-access automatic PGP encryption and end-to-end encryption via PGP, making message content inaccessible even to the service operators. Server logs are retained for just 5 days for technical operations and abuse prevention, and no IP addresses are stored for VPN/proxy services, though Intrusion Detection may capture IPs during anomalies. Registration requires only a username and password (hashed with SHA512/yescrypt), with 2FA (TOTP) available for added security. However, CodaMail isn’t fully anonymous—payments (via First Data/PayPal or cash) and U.S. jurisdiction may link a payer’s identity. Data isn’t sold or shared with third parties, except under valid U.S. legal requests (reviewed and challenged if overly broad, with user notification when allowed). For complete anonymity, using Tor and avoiding payment ties to real identity are recommended.  Use Cases: CodaMail is suitable for users who prioritize private correspondence with strong encryption and minimal data collection. It’s an excellent choice for:      Confidential communication using PGP (e.g., between tech-savvy users).     Individuals avoiding tracking by advertisers or analytics (no logs or tracking).     Those wanting control over access and encryption (e.g., via IMAP/POP3 settings and PGP keys). It’s not ideal for total anonymity (due to payments and U.S. jurisdiction) or bulk messaging (strict anti-spam measures). CodaMail is perfect for those who value security and are willing to manage their own keys and backups (no automatic backups to protect privacy), including professionals, privacy-conscious users, or small businesses needing secure email within the U.S. legal framework.",

Security & Anonymity: OffiDocs provides a high level of anonymity by not requiring personal information (name, email, phone number) for its services, including temporary file storage. No registration is needed, eliminating ties to a user’s identity.

The service uses cookies for sessions and ads (Google Adsense) and collects analytics via Google Analytics, which may include IP addresses but isn’t linked to individuals. Partnerships with Adgoal (in extensions) and BrightSDK (in mobile apps) involve IP collection for affiliate links or premium features, but without identifying the owner. Specific email encryption isn’t mentioned, though general data is protected with basic security measures (encryption and physical server safeguards). For full anonymity, using a VPN or Tor is recommended, as ad networks may track activity.

            "value": "### Description of Disroot Email in English  **Disroot** is a platform provided by the non-profit organization Stichting Disroot.org (Netherlands), featuring an email service (https://webmail.disroot.org) among other tools for communication and collaboration. Disroot focuses on privacy, freedom, and ethical use of technology based on free and open-source software.  **Security & Anonymity:** Disroot offers a high level of privacy through minimal data collection and a strict protection policy. Account creation requires only a temporary email (deleted after approval unless kept for recovery), a username, and a password. Activity logs (IP, actions) are stored for just 24 hours and not archived, minimizing traces. Emails are stored on servers in the Netherlands unencrypted by default, but users can apply GnuPG/PGP for end-to-end encryption. Data transmission is secured with SSL/TLS, and servers use disk encryption. Data isn’t sold or shared with third parties, except as required by federated services (e.g., sending an email to Gmail reveals the recipient’s address). Full anonymity isn’t guaranteed due to email’s federated nature and lack of built-in encryption—using VPN/Tor and self-encrypting emails is recommended for maximum protection. Losing a password results in irreversible access loss, as Disroot doesn’t hold master keys.  **Use Cases:** Disroot is suitable for users who value privacy, free speech, and a non-commercial approach to technology. It’s a good fit for: - Ethical correspondence with minimal tracking (especially with PGP encryption). - Activists, communities, or individuals avoiding corporate ecosystems and ads. - Those wanting to integrate email with other open services (Nextcloud, XMPP). It’s not suitable for commercial purposes (strictly prohibited), highly sensitive data without encryption, or users needing simplicity (requires technical awareness for optimal security). Disroot is ideal for open-source enthusiasts, small groups, or those willing to take security into their own hands within Dutch jurisdiction and GDPR compliance.",

It combines communication tools (email, chats, blogs) with principles of anti-fascism, anti-racism, and anti-authoritarianism, steering clear of commercialization.  Security & Anonymity: A/I prioritizes maximum privacy by collecting minimal data: only a username (email) and password, with no additional personal details (phone, address). The statement of intent required during registration is deleted after approval, and activity logs (IP, metadata) are kept for up to 15 days and anonymized. Servers employ disk encryption and SSL/TLS for data transmission, but there’s no built-in end-to-end encryption for emails—users can apply PGP themselves. A/I cannot access encrypted content and doesn’t sell data. Federated protocols (e.g., email) necessitate sharing the recipient’s address with other providers, reducing anonymity when communicating off-platform. Full anonymity isn’t guaranteed due to no backups and Internet vulnerabilities—using VPN/Tor and avoiding links to real identity is recommended for protection. Data is stored in the EU, with disclosure possible only under an Italian court order, accompanied by user notification if legally permitted.  Use Cases: A/I is suitable for those who share values of self-organization and resistance, avoiding commercial and authoritarian structures. It’s a good fit for:      Activists and social movements needing private correspondence (especially with PGP).     Individuals aiming to minimize their digital footprint without commercial ties.     Non-commercial projects, blogs, or mailing lists aligned with DIY and solidarity. It’s not suited for business purposes (prohibited), highly sensitive data without encryption, or users unprepared for technical self-reliance (no password recovery without a security question). A/I is ideal for radical communities valuing freedom and privacy within Italian jurisdiction and GDPR compliance.",
