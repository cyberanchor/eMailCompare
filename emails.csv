The service focuses on security and privacy, with a basic free tier (200 MB, no IMAP/SMTP) and paid plans with enhanced features. Security & Anonymity: Wölkli Mail employs 256-bit SSL encryption for data transmission and AES-256 server-side encryption for stored emails. It supports OpenPGP for message encryption and decryption, along with two-factor authentication (2FA). Emails are encrypted with user-specific cryptographic keys before reaching the inbox, preventing even the service provider from accessing their contents. Data is stored in Switzerland, benefiting from strict privacy laws (DSG). However, full anonymity isn’t guaranteed: registration requires a name, surname, and a strong password (min. 12 characters), and IP addresses may be logged. The privacy policy lacks detailed disclosure about data collection, leaving some uncertainty regarding anonymity. The free version (200 MB, 20 MB attachment limit, ad-free) is suitable for basic correspondence, temporary registrations, or non-sensitive data via the web interface (based on RainLoop, with Russian language support). Paid tiers, offering more storage and IMAP/SMTP access, are ideal for personal or professional use requiring encryption and reliability. Thanks to Swiss jurisdiction and cryptographic features, it’s a good fit for users prioritizing above-average privacy, though for maximum anonymity (e.g., no personal data required), alternatives like Proton Mail or Tutanota might be preferable."

It supports standard IMAP, SMTP, and POP3 protocols, enabling use with third-party clients (e.g., Outlook, Thunderbird). The service targets a broad audience, providing basic communication tools integrated with the portal. Security & Anonymity: Interia.pl employs SSL/TLS encryption for data transmission (port 993 for IMAP, 465 for SMTP), offering a baseline level of security. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is supported, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. However, it lacks end-to-end encryption, meaning email content is stored unencrypted on servers and accessible to administrators. Anonymity is limited: registration requires personal details (e.g., name), and the service collects internet data (IP, activity, device info), which may be shared with advertising partners (Google, Facebook) and authorities upon request. Data is stored in Poland (EU), adhering to GDPR, but may be transferred outside the EEA (e.g., to the USA) with standard contractual safeguards. A data breach in 2023 (14.2 KB, including emails) raises concerns about its security track record. Use Cases: The free Interia.pl email is suitable for everyday communication, website registrations, receiving newsletters, or casual use. Its IMAP/SMTP support makes it convenient for users who prefer desktop or mobile clients. However, due to weak anonymity and lack of end-to-end encryption, it’s not recommended for confidential correspondence or scenarios requiring high privacy (unlike Proton Mail or Tutanota).

Use Cases: Onet is suitable for everyday communication, news reading, and using additional features (forums, shopping) within a single platform, especially for Poland-based users or those comfortable in a Polish-language ecosystem.

Anonymity is minimal: registration via the app requires personal details (name, email, phone number, sometimes credit card), alongside device information (model, OS, IP, identifiers) and usage data (logs, queries, contacts). This data may be shared with partners (e.g., advertisers) or authorities upon request, with servers located across multiple countries, reducing privacy control. The privacy policy (last updated December 22, 2016) emphasizes personalization over anonymity. Datamail is suitable for basic communication, sending emails, syncing contacts, or registering on websites where high privacy isn’t a priority. The mobile app makes it convenient for phone-based users, particularly in India, where it’s promoted as a local alternative. However, due to weak anonymity, lack of end-to-end encryption, and extensive data collection, it’s not recommended for confidential correspondence or scenarios requiring identity protection (unlike Proton Mail or Tutanota). It’s a general-purpose tool for everyday tasks with moderate security, aimed at mainstream users."

IP addresses, emails, or phone numbers used for verification (e.g., via reCaptcha, SMS) are stored temporarily and hashed if retained long-term, making identification difficult. Permanent IP logs aren’t kept unless abuse (spam, attacks) occurs, where data may be stored to protect the service. Metadata (sender, recipient, subject, timestamps) is accessible due to SMTP limitations, but encrypted message content isn’t. Unencrypted incoming emails are scanned for spam and viruses, justified by user protection needs. Data isn’t shared with third parties except under binding Slovenian legal requests (with user notification if permitted). Payments via Stripe or anonymously (Bitcoin/cash) offer flexibility, though card linkage may reduce anonymity. For full anonymity, using Tor/VPN is recommended, as traffic passes through third-party networks.  Use Cases: Mailio is suitable for users seeking a private email service with strong data protection and minimal tracking. It’s a good fit for:      Confidential correspondence within the mail.io domain (fully encryption-protected).     Those aiming to minimize data collection and avoid ads (no analytics or third-party tracking).     Everyday communication with moderate anonymity needs (external emails aren’t encrypted by default). It’s not ideal for complete anonymity (due to potential metadata and payments) or bulk messaging (strict anti-spam measures). Mailio is optimal for individuals, freelancers, or small teams valuing simplicity, security, and inbox control within the European jurisdiction (GDPR)."

It offers a minimalist solution for email communication, avoiding excessive data collection and providing a basic level of anonymity and protection.  Security & Anonymity: Mailum ensures a high degree of anonymity through its minimal data collection policy. Registration requires only a username and password (hashed), with no need to provide personal details like a real name or email. IP addresses aren’t logged for website visitors, except for a 5-minute retention during registration to prevent account flooding (this data isn’t linked to users and is deleted afterward). The date of the last login is stored for managing inactive accounts, but no other activity traces are kept. The absence of logs and external trackers (e.g., for advertising) enhances privacy. Cookies are used solely for session identification, without additional tracking. However, there’s no mention of message or server encryption, suggesting a lack of default end-to-end encryption. Data isn’t shared with third parties, and GDPR/CCPA rights ensure user control over information. For full anonymity, using Tor or a VPN is recommended.

Mailum is optimal for low-risk everyday use where simplicity and lack of surveillance matter, especially when paired with additional anonymization tools. It’s a solution for minimalists who value basic privacy without complex configurations."

Accessible via https://codamail.com, CodaMail combines minimal data collection with robust encryption, offering a secure communication solution centered on privacy and user control.  Security & Anonymity: CodaMail ensures a high level of privacy through strict principles: it collects only the bare minimum of data (account name, subscription details, creation/expiration dates), and email content is individually encrypted at rest using elliptic-curve AES-GCM-256. It supports zero-access automatic PGP encryption and end-to-end encryption via PGP, making message content inaccessible even to the service operators. Server logs are retained for just 5 days for technical operations and abuse prevention, and no IP addresses are stored for VPN/proxy services, though Intrusion Detection may capture IPs during anomalies. Registration requires only a username and password (hashed with SHA512/yescrypt), with 2FA (TOTP) available for added security. However, CodaMail isn’t fully anonymous—payments (via First Data/PayPal or cash) and U.S. jurisdiction may link a payer’s identity. Data isn’t sold or shared with third parties, except under valid U.S. legal requests (reviewed and challenged if overly broad, with user notification when allowed). For complete anonymity, using Tor and avoiding payment ties to real identity are recommended.  Use Cases: CodaMail is suitable for users who prioritize private correspondence with strong encryption and minimal data collection. It’s an excellent choice for:      Confidential communication using PGP (e.g., between tech-savvy users).     Individuals avoiding tracking by advertisers or analytics (no logs or tracking).     Those wanting control over access and encryption (e.g., via IMAP/POP3 settings and PGP keys). It’s not ideal for total anonymity (due to payments and U.S. jurisdiction) or bulk messaging (strict anti-spam measures). CodaMail is perfect for those who value security and are willing to manage their own keys and backups (no automatic backups to protect privacy), including professionals, privacy-conscious users, or small businesses needing secure email within the U.S. legal framework."

Security & Anonymity: OffiDocs provides a high level of anonymity by not requiring personal information (name, email, phone number) for its services, including temporary file storage. No registration is needed, eliminating ties to a user’s identity. Data is stored temporarily on OffiDocs servers—on desktop, it’s deleted after 5 days of inactivity, and in mobile apps, after editing is complete—reducing the risk of leaks. The service uses cookies for sessions and ads (Google Adsense) and collects analytics via Google Analytics, which may include IP addresses but isn’t linked to individuals. Partnerships with Adgoal (in extensions) and BrightSDK (in mobile apps) involve IP collection for affiliate links or premium features, but without identifying the owner. Specific email encryption isn’t mentioned, though general data is protected with basic security measures (encryption and physical server safeguards). For full anonymity, using a VPN or Tor is recommended, as ad networks may track activity.  Use Cases: OffiDocs is suitable for users needing temporary, anonymous access to email or file services without long-term data retention. It’s a good fit for:      Short-term correspondence or document work where history retention isn’t needed.

Security & Anonymity: ContactOffice provides a basic level of privacy but does not position itself as a fully anonymous service. Registration requires truthful information (e.g., name and email), which is stored in the company’s database for service management and potential promotional campaigns (opt-out available). Users receive a unique ID and choose a password, but maintaining their confidentiality is the user’s responsibility.

Disroot focuses on privacy, freedom, and ethical use of technology based on free and open-source software.  **Security & Anonymity:** Disroot offers a high level of privacy through minimal data collection and a strict protection policy. Account creation requires only a temporary email (deleted after approval unless kept for recovery), a username, and a password. Activity logs (IP, actions) are stored for just 24 hours and not archived, minimizing traces. Emails are stored on servers in the Netherlands unencrypted by default, but users can apply GnuPG/PGP for end-to-end encryption. Data transmission is secured with SSL/TLS, and servers use disk encryption. Data isn’t sold or shared with third parties, except as required by federated services (e.g., sending an email to Gmail reveals the recipient’s address). Full anonymity isn’t guaranteed due to email’s federated nature and lack of built-in encryption—using VPN/Tor and self-encrypting emails is recommended for maximum protection. Losing a password results in irreversible access loss, as Disroot doesn’t hold master keys.  **Use Cases:** Disroot is suitable for users who value privacy, free speech, and a non-commercial approach to technology. It’s a good fit for: - Ethical correspondence with minimal tracking (especially with PGP encryption). - Activists, communities, or individuals avoiding corporate ecosystems and ads. - Those wanting to integrate email with other open services (Nextcloud, XMPP). It’s not suitable for commercial purposes (strictly prohibited), highly sensitive data without encryption, or users needing simplicity (requires technical awareness for optimal security). Disroot is ideal for open-source enthusiasts, small groups, or those willing to take security into their own hands within Dutch jurisdiction and GDPR compliance."

It combines communication tools (email, chats, blogs) with principles of anti-fascism, anti-racism, and anti-authoritarianism, steering clear of commercialization.  Security & Anonymity: A/I prioritizes maximum privacy by collecting minimal data: only a username (email) and password, with no additional personal details (phone, address). The statement of intent required during registration is deleted after approval, and activity logs (IP, metadata) are kept for up to 15 days and anonymized. Servers employ disk encryption and SSL/TLS for data transmission, but there’s no built-in end-to-end encryption for emails—users can apply PGP themselves. A/I cannot access encrypted content and doesn’t sell data. Federated protocols (e.g., email) necessitate sharing the recipient’s address with other providers, reducing anonymity when communicating off-platform. Full anonymity isn’t guaranteed due to no backups and Internet vulnerabilities—using VPN/Tor and avoiding links to real identity is recommended for protection. Data is stored in the EU, with disclosure possible only under an Italian court order, accompanied by user notification if legally permitted.  Use Cases: A/I is suitable for those who share values of self-organization and resistance, avoiding commercial and authoritarian structures. It’s a good fit for:      Activists and social movements needing private correspondence (especially with PGP).     Individuals aiming to minimize their digital footprint without commercial ties.     Non-commercial projects, blogs, or mailing lists aligned with DIY and solidarity. It’s not suited for business purposes (prohibited), highly sensitive data without encryption, or users unprepared for technical self-reliance (no password recovery without a security question).
