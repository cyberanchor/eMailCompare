## 🌐 Overview

**Yet Another Email Service Comparison** - is a project dedicated to comparing a wide range of email services, from privacy-focused to general-purpose providers. <br>
Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Chart.js, it offers a responsive web interface and data stored in `data.json`. <br>
Inspired by [**@Lissy93**](https://github.com/Lissy93)  [email-comparison](https://github.com/Lissy93/email-comparison). <br>
Also based on [**httpsmail.com**](https://www.httpsmail.com/mail/). <br>

🔗 **web**: [cyberanchor.github.io](https://cyberanchor.github.io/eMailCompare/web)

## 📊 Features

- **Interactive table**: displays email provider details (e.g., domain, jurisdiction, encryption).
- **Search & sort**: filter and sort services by keywords or columns.
- **Data export**: download email domains as a `.txt` file.
- **Responsive design**: optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Color-coded insights**: highlights privacy/security traits (e.g., green for minimal data collection).

## 🔍 Comparison criteria

Email services are evaluated based on the following criteria (all data collected from public source):

- **Security**: presence of end-to-end encryption, SSL/TLS, and two-factor authentication (2FA).
- **Privacy**: data collection practices, IP logging, third-party sharing, and personal information requirements (e.g., name, address).
- **Jurisdiction**: server location and applicable privacy laws (e.g., Swiss privacy, GDPR).
- **Intelligence alliance**: affiliation with surveillance networks (e.g., Five Eyes, Fourteen Eyes).
- **Registration requirements**: need for email or phone verification during account setup.
- **Pricing**: availability of free tiers and costs of premium plans.
- **Terms of Service (ToS)**: usage restrictions, such as prohibitions on spam, hacking, or commercial activities.
- **Infrastructure**: A/MX records, server hosting provider, and company ownership.
- **Domain details**: Primary and secondary domains, creation, and expiration dates.
