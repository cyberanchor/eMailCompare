## Overview

**Yet Another Email Service Comparison** is a project dedicated to comparing a wide range of email services, from privacy-focused to general-purpose providers. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Chart.js, it offers a responsive web interface and data stored in `data.json` for easy updates. Inspired by [**@Lissy93**](https://github.com/Lissy93) [email-comparison repository](https://github.com/Lissy93/email-comparison), this tool encourages community contributions to maintain an accurate dataset.
